## Type of Analysis

o	Standard NLP analysis for the review
o	Patterns and correlations between reviews and rating
o	Sentiment analysis
o	Meal type and meal type vs ratings or positive/negative reviews
o	Analysis Presentation/Visualization tool: PowerBI
o	Steps of the analysis:
**Data Preprocessing:**
•	Clean the text data by removing special characters, punctuation, and stopwords.
•	Tokenize the reviews into words or phrases.
•	Perform stemming or lemmatization to normalize the text.
**Sentiment Analysis:**
•	Use a pre-trained sentiment analysis model or train your own on labeled data to classify reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
•	Calculate the overall sentiment distribution of the reviews.
**Identifying Patterns:**
	Use techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) to identify significant keywords or phrases in positive and negative reviews.
	Look for common themes or topics mentioned in the reviews (e.g., food quality, service, ambiance).
**Topic Modeling:**
	Apply techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover latent topics within the reviews.
	Identify topics that are frequently mentioned and their associated sentiments.

## Visualization:
	Visualize sentiment distribution, word clouds of frequent terms, and topic distributions to gain a better understanding of the data.
	Plot trends over time to see if there are any changes in sentiment or topics.
